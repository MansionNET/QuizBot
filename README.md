## Common Issues and Solutions

### Connection Problems
1. Bot fails to connect to IRC server
   - Verify server address and port in settings.py
   - Check if SSL/TLS is required
   - Ensure server allows bot connections

2. Bot connects but doesn't join channels

   - Check if channels require authentication
   - Ensure bot has necessary permissions

### Question Generation
1. Questions stop generating
   - Check Mistral AI API key validity
   - Verify API rate limits haven't been exceeded
   - Check network connectivity
   - The bot will automatically retry and use fallback questions

2. Questions seem repetitive
   - Check question_history table isn't full

   - Clear question history if necessary

3. Answer validation issues
   - Add common variations to ALTERNATIVE_ANSWERS in settings
   - Adjust fuzzy matching threshold
   - Update diacritic mappings

### Database Issues
1. Database errors
   - Check file permissions on quiz.db
   - Verify SQLite version compatibility
   - Ensure sufficient disk space
   - Backup database regularly

### Performance
1. Bot becomes slow
   - Monitor API response times
   - Check database query performance
   - Reduce number of concurrent channels
   - Adjust question timeouts

2. High resource usage
